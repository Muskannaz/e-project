            <div class="faq-answer"><h4>DOG</h4>1. this is usually between 6 and 8 weeks and then every two weeks until approximately four months
                of age when it will receive the final round.<BR>
                    <h4>cat</h4>Immunizations are started at 6-8 weeks of age and are repeated every 3-4 weeks until the kitten is
                    4 months old. <BR></BR>
                    <h4>Rabbit</h4>Rabbits can be vaccinated from five weeks old. You'll also need a single, separate
                    vaccine to protect against R(V)HD2 at 10 weeks old. An annual vaccine that protects against all three diseases
                    in one dose can be given from five weeks old.  </div>

            <div class="faq-question"> WHAT ARE THE NAME OF THEY VACCINES?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer"> <h4>Dog</h4>The core vaccines are canine distemper, adenovirus-2, and parvovirus. Rabies vaccination is
                mandatory in many different jurisdictions. Canine respiratory disease vaccines include Parainfluenza 3, and
                Bordetella bronchiseptica. Other important bacterial vaccines include those against Lyme disease and
                Leptospirosis <BR></BR>
                <h4>Cat</h4>Combination Vaccine FVRCP, or feline distemper, FeLV for felines at risk of
                exposure to feline leukemia virus (cats that are unsupervised outdoors), and rabies annually as required by
                law. *A combination vaccine includes feline distemper, rhinotracheitis, and calicivirus. <BR></BR>

            <div class="faq-question">HOW LONG DO THEY VACCINES LAST?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer"> <h4>Dog</h4>To maintain the best protection against infectious diseases, revaccinations have proven very
                successful. As vaccines are improved over time, some do not need to be given as often, depending on
                individual
                circumstances. Most dogs with low-risk lifestyles can be vaccinated every three years with the core vaccines
                and as needed for any non-core vaccines (most non-core vaccines require annual boosters). Your veterinarian
                will discuss the need and frequency of booster vaccinations for your dog based on your dog's needs and
                lifestyle.<h4>Cat</h4>The AAFP vaccination guidelines recommend that low-risk adult cats be vaccinated every
                three years with the core vaccines, and then as determined by your veterinarian for any non-core vaccines.
                Some vaccine manufacturers have developed approved three-year doses for many of the core vaccines. <h4>
                  Rabbit
                </h4>Vaccination is very effective. Your rabbits can be injected from five weeks old. They'll need a booster
                with the triple combination vaccine every 12 months.

            <div class="faq-question"> WHAT ARE THEY NATURAL DIET?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer"> <H4>DOG</H4> In the case of dogs there is quite a lot of variety in their natural diet. Dogs are carnivores
                and the primary component of their diet is prey. This could be small animals mice, voles, rabbits, birds,
                insects and so forth or it could be larger prey caught with the help of a pack. Either way, they eat
                everything the internal organs, the meat, the bones, the lot. <br>
                <h4> CAT</h4>Being true carnivores they survived mainly on fresh small herbivores; rodents, birds and
                reptiles plus insects, and in the case of large cats, ruminants such as buffalo and deer. A cat will eat the
                whole of its prey fresh, including entire rabbits (gut contents, offal and nervous tissue included). <h4>
                  RABBIT</h4> Good quality hay and/or grass, always available, should constitute the majority of rabbits'
                diets. - Rabbits graze, naturally eating grass/other plants for long periods, mainly at dawn and dusk. -
                Rabbits' digestive systems need grass and/or hay to function properly.<BR></div>

            <div class="faq-answer"> <H4>DOG</H4> Good homemade food for healthy dogs includes all the vitamins, calcium, proteins and minerals
                your pet needs to stay healthy. You can add ground beef, chicken, lamb or venison, as well as vegetables,
                such as zucchini, carrots, parsnips, beets, yams, butternut squash, and sweet potatoes.. <H4>CAT</H4>
                homemade cat food recipe includes sufficient animal protein, calcium, phosphorus, iodine and vitamins. This
                is usually obtained from red meat, liver, kidney, heart, chicken and sometimes milk. <H4>RABBIT</H4> Good
                homemade food is vegetables include such things as bell peppers, zucchini, cucumber and brussels sprouts.
                You can also give such greens as carrot tops, dark lettuces, herbs, radish tops and sprouts, okra leaves and
                clover sprouts.</div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">IS ROTI SAFE FOR THEM?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer"><H4>DOG</H4>Chapati and roti or flatbread on the other hand aren't considered toxic. However, for dogs there
                really aren't any benefits to feeding it to them, even if it's as an occasional treat. The flavored
                flatbreads should also be kept away from them since they may contain ingredients that are harmful to pets.
                <H4>CAT</H4> Cats shouldn't eat bread on a regular basis but, rather, reserve it for a once in a while
                treat. <H4>RABBIT</H4> Please don't give your rabbit any wheat-based items like bread, pasta, rice, roti
                etc. A rabbit probably would not die from it but they would become sick as they can't digest grain like
                humans can. Rabbits have delicate and complex digestive systems.

                <div class="faq-question">  HOW DOES THE ENVIRONMENT AFFECT ON A DOG'S BEHAVIOUR?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer"><H4>DOG</H4>When your dog first experiences a new location or environment, there's no way of knowing how
                    they'll react. New sights, sounds, and smells could make them fearful, aggressive, or over-excited, but with
                    the proper training and introduction, most dogs will quickly adapt and start taking every new location in
                    stride. <H4>CAT</H4> Cats are territorial and become very attached to places. They are naturally frightened
                    of unfamiliar places and smells. For example, if you move your cat to a new home, it may be frightened by
                    the presence of cats that have already established territories in the area. <H4>RABBIT</H4> In rabbits, the
                    normal behavioral repertoire includes foraging and social behaviors, but confinement in barren cages reduces
                    locomotion and may lead to altered social behavior and the development of stereotypies (Morisse and Maurice,
                    1997, Hansen and Berthelsen, 2000, Verga et al., 2007).<BR></div>

                <div class="faq-question">  WHAT ARE THE EFFECT OF NOISY ENVIRONMENT ON DOG?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer"> <H4>DOG</H4> can lead to stress and anxiety in dogs, and in severe cases, it may cause actual physical
                    damage to their sensitive ear structures. Therefore, it's important to be mindful of the volume when playing
                    music around your canine companion. <H4>CAT</H4>Cats associate loud noise with danger, which is why they
                    have a natural aversion to sudden bangs and booms. But while it's normal for cats to dislike noise to a
                    certain extent, some cats can be so scared of noises that they develop heightened sensitivity to sound, or
                    so-called 'noise phobia'. <H4>RABBIT</H4>Rabbits hear sounds more clearly than humans and loud noises can
                    terrify them, sending their adrenal glands into overdrive, and their heart racing. Some rabbits can
                    literally die of fright..</div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">HOW CAN THE ENVIRONMENT AFFECT A DOG?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer"><H4>DOG</H4> Your dog needs a safe, comfortable place to rest, situated in a dry, draught-free area. Living
                    in a cold or damp place can lead to unnecessary suffering. If your dog lives outside, it will need
                    protection from adverse weather or other threats. <H4>CAT</H4> Living in a cold or wet place, without
                    shelter, can lead to unnecessary suffering. A cat must be able to avoid things that scare it, including
                    other cats. They all need a place to hide where they feel safe. They often feel safest when high up. <H4>
                      RABBIT</H4> Your rabbit's resting area should have at least two compartments. A darkened sheltered area
                    for sleeping away from noise and another for eating/relaxing. All areas should be well ventilated, dry and
                    draught free as damp, poorly ventilated, hot or dirty environments can cause illness
